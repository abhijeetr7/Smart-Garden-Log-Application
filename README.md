# Smart-Garden-Log-Application

ü™¥ Smart Garden Log
A simple yet effective web application designed to help gardeners and nature hobbyists track and manage their plants' needs and growth.

üí° Concept
The Smart Garden Log aims to simplify plant care by providing a centralized system to log essential information, set reminders, and track the progress of your beloved plants. No more guessing when to water or fertilize ‚Äì let the app keep you organized!

üîß Features
Add Plants: Easily add new plants to your log with customizable details.

Set Sunlight Needs: Choose from options like Full Sun, Partial Sun, Partial Shade, or Full Shade.

Define Watering Frequency: Specify how often your plant needs water (in days).

Set Fertilizing Frequency: Track how often to fertilize (in days), with an option to set to 0 if not applicable.

Water/Fertilize Log & Reminder System:

Quickly log when you last watered or fertilized a plant with a single click.

The app automatically calculates and displays the next due date for watering and fertilizing.

Visual Reminders: Plant cards will highlight (red border and pulse animation) when watering or fertilizing is due, ensuring you never miss a crucial care step.

Photo Upload & Growth Tracker:

Add detailed growth logs for each plant, including notes.

Upload photos to visually track your plant's growth over time.

View a comprehensive growth history for any plant, sorted by date.

Edit & Delete Plants: Easily update plant details or remove plants from your log.

Persistent Storage: All your plant data and growth logs are securely saved using Firestore (Firebase), so your information is always available across sessions.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern, and responsive design that works well on various devices.

Custom Modals: Utilizes custom modal dialogs for a consistent and non-disruptive user experience, replacing native browser alerts and confirms.

üöÄ How to Use
Add a New Plant: Click the "Add New Plant" button. Fill in the plant's name, select its sunlight needs, and specify watering and fertilizing frequencies. Click "Save Plant".

Manage Your Plants: Your added plants will appear as cards on the main page.

Log Actions: Click the "üíß Log Water" or "üß™ Log Fertilize" buttons to record the current date as the last time you performed that action.

Edit Plant Details: Click the pencil icon on a plant card to modify its information.

Delete Plant: Click the trash can icon to remove a plant (a confirmation will appear).

Track Growth:

Add Growth Log: Click the "üìà Add Growth Log" button on a plant card. You can add notes and upload a photo to document its progress.

View Growth History: Click the "üìö View History" button to see all recorded growth logs and photos for that plant.

Reminders: Keep an eye on the plant cards. If a plant's "Next Water" or "Next Fertilize" date is today or in the past, its card will be visually highlighted to remind you.

üíª Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure of the web application.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all the interactive logic, data handling, and DOM manipulation.

Firebase:

Firestore: A NoSQL cloud database used for real-time data storage and synchronization of plant information and growth logs.

Firebase Authentication: Used for anonymous user authentication to manage private user data.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup (for local development)
This application is designed to run directly in a browser environment that provides the __app_id and __firebase_config global variables, typically within a specialized platform.

To run this code in a standard local development environment, you would need to:

Set up a Firebase Project:

Go to the Firebase Console.

Create a new project.

Enable Firestore Database and Authentication (specifically, enable Anonymous authentication).

Get Your Firebase Config: In your Firebase project settings, find your web app's configuration object.

Update the Code: Replace the placeholder __app_id and __firebase_config variables in the <script type="module"> section with your actual Firebase project ID and config object.

Set Firestore Security Rules:
To allow users to read and write their own data, you'll need to set up Firestore Security Rules. Here's an example for private user data:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/{documents=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}

Open in Browser: Save the HTML file and open it directly in your web browser.

Enjoy tracking your garden's journey with the Smart Garden Log!
